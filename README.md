some demos to use gpt4 and gpt3.5 to control the hardware,on the embedded boards like raspberry pi,these are the demo code that is generated automaticaly by GPT,
the code is mostly generated with python,very few of them are written by c, every code has been run and tested ,passed with ok.
these demos can show you how gpt can do with your daily hardware software design,and software debug
